# @hacksjs/universal

This is a package of pure ECMAScript utility functions enhanced with TypeScript-compatible static type information.

A small number of functions use host-specific APIs — such as Node.js and web platform APIs — where available, but always with pure-ES fallbacks to ensure universal compatibility with all modern JavaScript runtime environments.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @hacksjs/universal
yarn add @hacksjs/universal
pnpm add @hacksjs/universal
```
