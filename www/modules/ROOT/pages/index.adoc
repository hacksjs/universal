This package is a collection of pure ECMAScript and universal JavaScript (aka isomorphic JavaScript) utility functions. Everything in this package is compatible with every major modern JavaScript runtime environment, including — but not limited to — web browsers and Node.

A small number of functions use host-specific APIs — such as Node.js and web platform APIs — where available, but always with pure-ES fallbacks to ensure universal compatibility with all modern JavaScript runtime environments.

As with other Hacks.js packages, this package is full typed, shipping with complete type definitions for compatibility with TypeScript applications.
