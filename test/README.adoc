= Tests

This directory contains automated test scripts.

Currently, there are three categories of automated tests:

* *Unit* tests, which verify the behavior of individual functions and classes.
* *Integration* tests, which verify expected behaviors when multiple functions are used together in a pipeline.
* *Types* tests, which verify the correctness of the dynamically-generated *.d.ts files.
